1. Retrieve all players, then write a program that will loop through each player and display their team name, mascot and stadium. How many queries have we done?
    
    players = Player.all
    players.each do |player|
        p "Player name: #{player.name}, Player Team name: #{player.team.name}, Player Mascot: #{player.team.mascot}, Player Stadium: #{player.team.stadium}"
    end

2. Retrieve all players and write a program to loop through each player and their team name, mascot and stadium using .includes. How many queries have we done now?

    players = Player.all
    players.includes(:team).each do |player|
        p "Player name: #{player.name}, Player Team name: #{player.team.name}, Player Mascot: #{player.team.mascot}, Player Stadium: #{player.team.stadium}"
    end

    We've only used two queries now as opposed to 500 for each player.

3. Retrieve all players from the 'Chicago Bulls' by using .includes

    players = Player.all
    players.includes(:team).where("teams.name = 'Chicago Bulls'").references(:team)

4. Retrieve all players along with the team name that play at the 'Staples Center'

    Player.includes(:team).where("teams.stadium = 'Staples Center'").references(:team).each do |player|
        p "Player name : #{player.name} and Team: #{player.team.name}"
    end

5. Retrieve all teams that have any player that start their name with the letter 'Z' by using .includes and .joins

    players = Player.all
    players.includes(:team).where("players.name LIKE 'z%'").references(:team).each do |player|
        p "Player name: #{player.name} and Team: #{player.team.name}"
    end

    players.joins(:team).where("players.name LIKE 'z%'").each do |player|
        p "Player name: #{player.name} and Team: #{player.team.name}"
    end

    players.joins(:team).includes(:team).where("players.name LIKE 'z%'").references(:team).each do |player|
        p "Player name: #{player.name} and Team: #{player.team.name}"
    end
